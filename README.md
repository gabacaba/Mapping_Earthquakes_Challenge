# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Overview
This challenge consist on creating an Earthquake map in relation to the tectonic's plate location on earth. This map will show all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. To do so, the challenge will gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API. It'd be requiered to have a Mapbox account and know how to interact with an API as well as how to request JSON data from a server. 

## Results

There are three deliverables for this challenge. 
- Deliverable 1: A map showing the tectonic's plate location on earth. 
- Deliverable 2: A map showing all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5
- Deliverable 3: An additional map with a different Mapbox style. For this challenge I've chosen "dark mode".  

## Summary

The map shows a correlation between tectonic plates and major Earthquakes. The Pacific Plate's Ring of fire is known to be the most active tectonic plate in the world. It can be seen around Eurasia and Australia. The Nazca and Coco's plate in Central and South America are also very active. The are some major Earthquakes in North America that seem to not be related to tectonic plates as there's none passing by. It'd be interesting to investigate what originates those earthquakes. 

Something that could be shown in a future map is the volcanic and mountainous zones. It is stated that there's a correlation between volcanic and mountainous areas with Earthquakes. It'd be interesting to display this on a map.
